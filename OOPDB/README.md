# Zwischen

The Car Sharing Application

## Project: Zwischen

Not every student at Fgcu has access to a car, and those who do may not have the desire to constantly use their own gas.
Compiled with FGCUâ€™s focus on environmental care, students have every reason to carpool. Zwischen is a ride sharing app,
designed to help students at FGCU get around, as well as helping to reduce car emissions and forming friendships.

note: This is the original version of Zwischen. For the updated version, click [here](https://github.com/zgreening/ZwischenV2.0.git).

## Installation:

Create a new project, clone source files from github, goto product structure and add derby.jar as dependency module.

### Dependencies

derby.jar

## Usage:

At first use, click the create account button, and fill in the text boxes with the appropriate information.
Once your account is created, log in, and either set your schedule by clicking the Driver Schedule button, 
or request a ride with the Request Ride button. Over time, friends can be added,
allowing for greater consistency of scheduling through the app.
These skills demonstrate sql commands. We use update, delete, insert, ect.
